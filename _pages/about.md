I am a 3rd-year PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering at **Aarhus University**, Denmark, under the supervision of Prof. [Xuping Zhang](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/xuzh%40mpe.au.dk).

My research focuses on **3D Computer Vision** and **Robotics**, with key interests in 3D scanning, point cloud processing, and 3D object detection. I am passionate about applying these technologies to robotics, particularly in 3D object manipulation and grasping, to develop innovative solutions for manufacturing automation.

As I work towards completing my PhD by **June 2025**, I am actively seeking (research) *internship opportunities* and exploring career paths in *Computer Vision Algorithm, Robotics and Production Automation*. Feel free to reach out! You can view my CV [here](assets/pdf/Leihui_CV_JOB.pdf).
